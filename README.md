#  Codeforces

Welcome to my **Codeforces grind diary** – a public repo where I upload the solutions to the problems I’ve solved  
(or been emotionally damaged by) on Codeforces. 

This repo is my personal stash of Codeforces problems I've:
- Wrestled with  
- Cried over  
- And finally defeated (sometimes with dignity, sometimes not)

Whether you're looking for:  
- A solution that actually works (yay!)  
- Or just someone else who feels your WA pain...  

You're in the right place!
